# Public Key Cryptography

_A quick introduction, by Eli_

<!--
- Thank for coming
  - I've been threatening to do this talk for longer...
  - Writing is difficult and I'm quite lazy
  - Your patience is appreicated

- Set expectations
  - Tried not to assume much background, but  unavoidably technical
  - Very initialism-heavy, tried to tamp down
  - Start below knowledge already have,
  - Hopefully by end risen above and we'll all have learnt something

- If baffling or wrong, jump in
  - Otherwise questions at end
-->
