# Public Key Cryptography

_A quick introduction, by Eli_

<!--
- Thank for coming
  - I've been threatening to do this talk for longer...
  - Writing is difficult and I'm quite lazy
  - Your patience is appreicated

- Set expectations
  - Tried not to assume much background, but  unavoidably technical.
  - Tried to avoid maths
  - Very initialism-heavy, tried to tamp down
  - Start below knowledge already have,
  - Hopefully by end risen above and we'll all have learnt something

- If baffling or wrong, jump in
  - Otherwise questions at end

<b>Encryption:</b> Using an algorithm to combine some data with a key so it can only be read by an
intended recipient

<b>Symmetric Encryption:</b> Using the same key to encrypt and decrypt data

<p>
<b>Asymmetric Encryption:</b> Algorithms which use one key for encryption, and another key for decryption.
</p>

<div v-click class="eqn">
  <Key hue="295">a</Key> and <Key hue="295">A</Key>
</div>

<div v-click class="eqn">
My Secret Data &#8727; <Key hue="295">A</Key> &#8658; <Encrypt key-id="A" hue="295">My Secret Data</Encrypt>
</div>

<div v-click class="eqn">
<Encrypt key-id="A" hue="295">My Secret Data</Encrypt> &#8727; <Key hue="295">a</Key> &#8658; My Secret Data
</div>

<p>
<span v-click>We can publish one of these keys, and keep the other private.</span>
<span v-click> Now we can send and receive encrypted data without sending a secret key.</span>
</p>

<!--
Asymmetric encryption is what we're focusing on today. The idea is different keys
[click] Let's call this pair of keys little a and big a
[click] You encrypt with one...
[click] But need to use the other to decrypt. The same would work in reverse

I don't want to go into the details of the maths today. All you need to know
is some very clever people developed these systems using the properties of certain
mathematical operations.

When people say prime numbers are important for cryptography, they mean this.

Rivest, Shamir and Adleman invented the first system that could do this in the '70s,
and it relies on prime numbers.

These days we also have systems that use operations on functions called Elliptic Curves as well.

[click] This lets us do something very clever.
[click] This is going to solve our chicken-and-egg problem.

Let's go through this in detail.

## Key exchange

<v-clicks>

**Speed:** Asymmetric encryption is hundreds of times slower than symmetric

**Forward Secrecy:** If your key is compromised, so is everything you've ever done with it

We need a way to make **symmetric**, **short-lived** keys

The algorithm we'll use is called **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**

</v-clicks>

<!--

[click] If those keys leak, they compromise every past use of them

Back to Alice and Bob.
[click] Going to abstract over the maths again
[click][click][click][click][click][click][click] That was kind of weird, so let's linger here

We've done maths on two different pieces of information and got the same result. The properties here are important.

[click] This is what we wanted by doing this at all
[click] They both had to participate to get this result, and can check each other's work
[click] They sent a hash, but not K itself, so everything private is private.

We've put together a secure channel with these useful properties. That's Diffie Hellman key exchange.

## SSH Handshake

<v-clicks>

Alice verified the server is really Bob

Bob verified the client is really Alice

They've got an encrypted channel for the session, so nobody can snoop

</v-clicks>

## TLS Handshake

<v-clicks>

Diffie-Hellman still works for setting up an encrypted channel

Proving server identity is harder

</v-clicks>

<!--
TLS is the protocol that secures HTTPS exchanges

There's a handshake before the HTTP request in the same way as SSH

More difficult is figuring out if you're talking to who you think you're talking to.

In SSH, Bob just sent a public key. What happens when you get a public key you don't recognise?
Not good enough for web

Instead Bob sent key signed by C. Who's C?

## TLS Handshake

<v-clicks>

We rely on CAs and distributors to vouch for server identity

You can run this infrastructure privately but it's a pain

## Summary

<v-clicks>

A lot of very smart people have let us rely on maths for trust and secrecy.

Do roll your own crypto, but don't deploy it to prod.
